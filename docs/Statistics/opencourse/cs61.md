# UCB CS61 Series
> 24Summer Online

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

- [CS 61A ](https://cs61a.org/)concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
- [CS 61B](https://sp24.datastructur.es/) deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
- [CS 61C](https://cs61c.org/sp24/) focuses on machines and how they execute programs.
