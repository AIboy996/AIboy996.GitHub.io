# <i>I Just Called to Say I Love You</i>

无需多言神曲，主歌**如诗一般**（我建议加入中学英语课本），副歌朗朗上口（更是直抒胸臆）～

Stevie Wonder这位盲人歌手对嗓音的细腻把控令人如痴如醉😭

[Verse 1]
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day

[Verse 2]
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, it's something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 3]
No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

[Verse 4]
No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you, yeah
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Outro]
Of my heart, of my heart
Baby, of my heart
```
